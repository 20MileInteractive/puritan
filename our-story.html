			<h4>Our Story</h4>

			<p>
				Puritan's founder, Abraham Penn, taught a valuable lesson that has been a part of the Puritan Tradition since 1919 when he said: "I'd rather make a friend than make a sale." Since that time, Puritan has made many, many friends and continues to do so to this day.

				He began in a modest Plymouth, MA store he and his partner purchased for $4,000. They believed they had to provide classic, impeccably tailored clothing and personalized service in order to succeed, and each had to be of the highest quality possible. In 1925, after expanding the business to include uniform sales, they expanded geographically with the first of the on-Cape stores. It was located in Chatham, MA, and they chose that location in order to service the nearby Coast Guard Station, as well as Chatham residents. It was the uniform sales that proved critical in helping the still young company survive the Depression years.

				Abe's sons, Milton and Howard, both joined their father's business at early ages, working in the Plymouth store filling orders and wrapping packages. When the Hyannis store was opened, they could be seen sweeping sidewalks and washing the storefront windows. These experiences taught them the value of hard work and attention to detail, traits that would serve them well when they assumed responsibility for the stores later in life. In turn, they passed these values on to their own children, so that Puritan today is in the hands of third generation Penns.

				Today, Rick and Jim Penn, the 3rd generation of the Penn Family bring to the office every day the lessons they learned from their grandfather and fathers. They manage the operation of a 50+ person sales force and support staff for the five locations, which includes four Puritan Cape Cod stores and a company owned Vineyard Vines concept store.

				The philosophy instilled in them by Abraham, Milton, &amp; Howard, still forms the foundation of their business. The core value of building relationships established by their grandfather, Abraham Penn over 90 years ago, is still relevant today. It is a testament to the Penn family that they also practice what they preach when it comes to relationships with more than half of their associates achieving more than 10 years of service, and some for more than a quarter century!
